Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

Developed a Web Application using HTML, Flask, Bootstrap, Python, Heidi SQL. This project aims at finding significant features by applying genetic algorithm and decision tree algorithm resulting in improving the accuracy in the prediction of heart disease. Patients can seamlessly interact with our application by giving an input of their relevant medical data, allowing our algorithm to analyse and process the information efficiently.
